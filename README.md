## Configuring enabled features

To turn off one or more feature, use the `AdvancedCMSFormsOptions` options class and then, for example, in the initialization module, set `false` on the feature that should not be available. All features are enabled by default. 
 
```csharp
[InitializableModule]
public class CustomFormsModule : IInitializableHttpModule
{
    public void Initialize(InitializationEngine context)
    {
        var options = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance<AdvancedCMSFormsOptions>();
        options.InlineEditing = false;
        options.InlinePublish = false;
    }

    public void Uninitialize(InitializationEngine context)  {  }

    public void InitializeHttpEvents(HttpApplication application) {  }
}
 ```
